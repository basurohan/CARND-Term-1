# Project files for Self Driving Car Nanodegree

### Term 1 Projects
* CarNd-LaneLines-P1
  * Project to detect lane lines in images and video clips using Python and OpenCV.
* CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
  * Project to apply deep learning and train a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Dataset.
* CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3
  * Apply deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior - train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle - which will be driven around a simulator.
* CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines
  * Write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car.
* CarND-Vehicle-Detection
  * Write a software pipeline to identify vehicles in a video from a front-facing camera on a car.
